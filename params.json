{"name":"Voxel","tagline":"Open Source Voxel Engine","body":"# Voxel\r\nThis is a voxel engine type that is programmed in Java, using LWJGL and OpenGL3.3+ . Is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing you to modify specific parts of the code and improve it, it is in a very early stage of development. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen the project is in a more stable and complete stage, my plan is to develop an API for the implementation of mods.\r\n\r\n# Build Status\r\n[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Guerra24/Voxel/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Guerra24/Voxel/latest)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n- Lharing: Ores generation algorithm.\r\n- quew8: Fixing the chunk movement. http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/lwjgl-opengl-3-3-voxel-chunk-management/35879/view.html\r\n- ThinMatrix: GLSL, Timming and Day/Night Cycle. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ\r\n- Paul Lamb: Sound. http://www.paulscode.com\r\n\r\n# Licenses\r\n\"This software is based on or using the J-Ogg library available from\r\nhttp://www.j-ogg.de and copyrighted by Tor-Einar Jarnbjo.\"\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-65216409-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
