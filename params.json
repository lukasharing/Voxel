{"name":"Voxel","tagline":"Open Source Voxel Engine","body":"# Voxel\r\nThis is a voxel engine type that is programmed in Java, using LWJGL and OpenGL3.3+ . Is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing you to modify specific parts of the code and improve it, it is in a very early stage of development. Below I leave the list of completed things, which are in progress and remains to add. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen the project is in a more stable and complete stage, my plan is to develop an API for the implementation of mods.\r\n\r\n# Build Status\r\n[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Guerra24/Voxel/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Guerra24/Voxel/latest)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nLharing: Ores generation algorithm.\r\n--- quew8: Fixing the chunk movement. http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/lwjgl-opengl-3-3-voxel-chunk-management/35879/view.html\r\n--- ThinMatrix: GLSL, Timming and Day/Night Cycle. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ\r\n--- Paul Lamb: Sound. http://www.paulscode.com\r\n\r\n# In Process\r\n+ Sound 0%\r\n+ World Save and Loading 0%\r\n+ GUI 10%\r\n+ Block Culling 98%\r\n\r\n# COMPLETED\r\n+ Ilumination (BUGED)\r\n+ Day/Night Cycle\r\n+ PNWG (Perlin Noise World Generation)\r\n+ Finite Terrain\r\n+ Frustum Culling\r\n\r\n# To Add\r\n+ Blocks collisions \r\n+ Bind Player and Camera class\r\n+ Physics\r\n+ API\r\n\r\n# Licenses\r\n\"This software is based on or using the J-Ogg library available from\r\nhttp://www.j-ogg.de and copyrighted by Tor-Einar Jarnbjo.\"\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-65216409-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
